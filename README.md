# Prework Study Guide

## Description

Here you will find my first bootcamp project!

It was developed to create a general study guide for the topics we were going to learn about, and have a reference point for further lessons if by any chance I get stuck or need a refresher!

It's nice to have something simple, easy to access, and user-friendly in a pinch. There's nothing worse than getting stuck on something and trying to sift through your entire computer, scrounging every file you've touched up until this point to find a piece of information you could easily just store in a study guide.
In doing so, I learned a lot about HTML formatting, CSS styling and even a little JavaScript (for now).

Enjoy!
